# Chat-Program-in-UDP
Programmed a chatting interface which can be used in any challenged network situation which does not have proper infrastructural support. Socket Programming can be implemented to make
such a chat portal because that proposes lesser data loss and much more efficiency. It is a full-duplex chat system for both server and client. It follows the User Datagram Protocol which is a faster but less reliable data transmission protocol compared to Transmission Contol Protocol.
