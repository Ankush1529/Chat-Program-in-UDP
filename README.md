# Chat-Program-in-UDP
Programmed a chatting interface which can be used in any challenged network situation which does not have proper infrastructural support. Socket Programming can be implemented to make
such a chat portal because that proposes lesser data loss and much more efficiency. It is a full-duplex chat system for both server and client. It follows the User Datagram Protocol which is a faster but less reliable data transmission protocol compared to Transmission Contol Protocol.

The implemented code will broadcast a message at a regualr intervals of time and all other pc devices in the network will respond to the broadcast with their ip addresses and also the time of at which their ip is discovered. This piece of code was integrated for finding out neighbouring ip addresses of machines during a post disaster situation where communication. The code sends a check message at regular intervals of 5 secs broadcasting from the pc and is waiting for any response from the client to acknowledge their presence. The server responds by listing out the time and the ip addresses of all the machines (one being the broadcasting machine itself) responding to it after every 5 secs . On entering the command "list", all the ip addresses are listed that have connected till now. Compiling a java code in linux terminal is easy Type the command "javac finalSocketClient.java && java finalSocketClient" in the directory where the code is present.
